# Stanford Snyder Lab Challenge

This repository contains the code for this challange and this readme should guide you through the entire repository and the performed tasks.

# Tasks
- ## Task 0.a: Data Volume Estimation
    The data volume estimation task as mentioned in the challenge description has been solved in the notebook linked below.
    
    [Task 0.a: Data Volume Estimation](./notebooks/data_estimates.ipynb)

- ## Task 0.b: Data Extraction
    [Task 0.b: Data Extraction](./notebooks/data_extraction.ipynb)

    The data was extracted according to the instructions provided in the PDF. While exporting to JSON, an issue arose because the heart rate metric contains `int64` and `float64` values, which are not directly JSON serializable by Pythonâ€™s standard `json` module. So we had to convert these values to standard Python types (`int` and `float`) before serialization. The code for this task is provided in the notebook linked below and this [file](./misc/create_data.py)
    **Error encountered:**
    ```

    To create the data, there is a simplified version I created for it, you can just run the following command in the terminal while being in project root directory:
    ```bash
    chmod +x ./setup.sh
    ./setup.sh
    ```
